								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm a final-year student from the National University of Singapore (NUS) majoring in Data Science & Analytics (Hons.) with a 2nd major in Computer Science (focus area in Artificial Intelligence).</p>
								<p>My project span a wide range of topics. Spanning from image classification (computer vision), text recommender systems (NLP), fall detection models (anomaly detection) and more, my diverse array of machine learning models covers a broad spectrum of industries and problem domains. Check out the <a href="#projects"> projects</a> I've done!</p>

						<article id="projects">
							<h2 class="major">Fall Detection Device</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/elderly falling 3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This was a project under one of my Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) from NUS called NUS MedTech. The project is named "Project Morphine" and involves building a wearable fall detection device to detect falls in elderly persons.</p> 
							<p>As you might have guessed, this project's interdisciplinary nature brought together students from the biomedical engineering major, computer science major, and data science major (that's me!) together. Under the data science team which consists of two members, I was directly involved in the entire data science lifecycle for this project - from data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, model evaluation, and deployment. Our initial prototype garnered the Gold award from the Biomedical Engineering Society (BES) design competition. Click to find out more!</p>
							<p>Skills: Anomaly Detection, Variational Autoencoders, Autoencoders, Tensorflow, Git, Docker, Google Firebase</p>

							<h2 class="major">University Recommender System</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/recommender 3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>As prospective university students in Singapore finish their A levels or diploma, it can be extremely confusing and difficult to decide which university to enrol in. Some local universities do not publish module information publicly online, which further adds to the dilemma. This project aims to help students interested in data science to choose which local university they should consider based on their career interests. These recommendations also take into account the skills demanded by the job market today using an automated web scraper for JobStreet and MyCareersFuture.</p> 
							<p>From scraping job description information from job posting sites, to prompt engineering for generating data using ChatGPT, all the way to leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Word2Vec models and more, this project displays a wide spectrum of tools & techniques used throughout different stages of the data science lifecycle. Click to find out more!</p>
							<p>Skills: Web Scraping (Selenium), ChatGPT, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, Word Vectorizer models (Word2Vec, TFIDF), SpaCy, NLTK, Gensim, Unit Testing, Git, Docker</p>

							<h2 class="major">Weapon Detection</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/weapon.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>With gun-related crimes on the rise, this project aims to develop a weapon detection system to classify images into three categories: Normal (no weapon), Carrying (weapon detected, not posing a threat to anyone), Threat (weapon detected and is a threat).</p>
							<p>This project taught me the basics of computer vision. It displays knowledge of image augmentation techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as well as the Grad-CAM method for model interpretability. Click to find out more!</p>
							<p>Skills: Image Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Image Preprocessing, Image Augmentation, OpenCV, PIL, Tensorflow, Grad-CAM, Data Cleaning</p>

							<h2 class="major">Discrete Event Simulator (DES)</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/DES.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A Discrete Event Simulator (DES) is a simulation of operations at a particular instance of time. To put it in layman's terms, it simulates a queue. Think of it as a way to simulate customers queuing at your favourite fast food chain. There are multiple cashiers (servers) and multiple customers, each arriving at a predetermined time and taking up different amounts of time to be served (processed).</p>
							<p>The applications of the DES can be seen throughout almost every industry. We have briefly illustrated the simplistic queue system in a fast food chain above. You could also use the DES to simulate the operations of a port. For instance, you could use the simulator to model the movement of cargo ships and the loading and unloading of containers. This simulation could help port operators evaluate different scenarios such as varying vessel arrival rates, changing berth allocation strategies, or implementing new cargo handling procedures.</p>
							<p>By simulating the entire process, the DES could provide insights into potential bottlenecks, congestion points, and optimal resource allocation. This could aid in making informed decisions to streamline operations, reduce waiting times for vessels, and ultimately enhance the efficiency and profitability of the port.</p>
							<p>Skills: Software Engineering, Java, Simulation</p>

							<h2 class="major">Early Detection of Crop Diseases</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Crops.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project served as my introduction to the world of deep learning. Its purpose was to construct a model capable of detecting signs of diseases in crops. The application of this project aligns with vertical farming, a growing trend in Singapore as the government aims for greater self-reliance in food sources. Prompt detection of crop issues not only enables swift treatment but, more crucially, prevents the spread of infectious diseases among crops, which could severely impact crop yield.</p>
							<p>The solution employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained through supervised learning. We utilized an open-source image dataset from Kaggle, encompassing images of healthy and infected crops across various species like tomatoes, potatoes, and corn. Ultimately, our efforts resulted in achieving commendable accuracy, precision, and recall measures exceeding 90%.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Sembcorp Industries</h2>
								<b style="font-size: 20px">Data Science Intern - Predictive Asset Management (PAM)</b>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/turbine.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<b>Overview</b>
								<p>My experience at Sembcorp Industries was an extremely fulfilling one. My primary focus was around the predictive maintenance of wind turbines across India using the sensor data of various sensors positioned on the turbine components. This was a rather crucial task as the company's maintenance team decides which turbines to inspect and repair based on the predictions of the model built to identify anomalies. Because of this, this role exposed me to different anomaly detection methods such as statistical methods like the Standard Deviation method, distance-based methods using Mahalanobis distance, clustering-based methods such as DBSCAN, and deep learning methods.</p>
								
								<b>Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Model</b>
								<p>Developing the variational autoencoder (VAE) was perhaps my biggest pride and joy throughout the 8 months I spent in the company. It involved months of trial and error, reading countless TowardsDataScience and Medium articles, studying academic papers, reading open-source code and not to mention, tons of mistakes. During the process, I learnt about the inner workings of an autoencoder and VAE model, how to use reconstruction loss to classify datapoints, other applications of autoencoder models such as image generation, what latent distributions are, what the Kullback-Leiber loss is and how it quantifies the difference between distributions, and how to code it out on Tensorflow. For someone who has had no prior experience in anomaly detection, this was definitely a steep learning curve, to say the least. Nonetheless, seeing the model output predictions with high precision and recall scores gave me a sense of accomplishment I will never forget. Though the project has been put on hold for priority on other tasks, I definitely succeeded in making a proof-of-concept for my successor to take over.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/VAE.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<b>Power Curve Modelling</b>
								<p>Besides building the VAE model, I was also involved in the statistical modelling of something known as the Power Curve model, which is a curve that tells us the expected power generated by a wind turbine at a given wind speed. The process of building this power curve once again, reading up on the current literature on what the best ways are to model the power curve. My research taught me about the different curves used to model a power curve such as the 5-parameter logistic growth function, sigmoid function, and the Weibull CDF function. Besides this, reading the academic papers, unexpectedly, not only taught me about the power curve, but also a lot about wind turbines in general as well. For example, it taught me how some mechanical components of the turbine work such as the anemometer which measures wind speed and the yaw system which rotates the wind turbine. Besides that, I also learnt about the safety mechanisms to protect the components from being badly damaged if the wind speed is too high (for example, during a tornado). And to answer your question, no. The wind turbine won't generate enormous amounts of power during a tornado because the yaw system rotates the turbine head to minimize blade movements caused by the wind, after which the turbine shuts off.</p>
